Data-Project---Public relations -NLP Sentiment-Department

The objective of the project is to create a prediction model that through customer reviews can indicate positive or negative sentiment.
A sample of comments on the Echo product by Alexa on Amazon has been used as Dataframe.
To create the model, NLP libraries such as Nltk have been used. We have proceeded with the cleaning of the text, tokenization and vectorization.
The model is composed of a Na√Øve Bayes classifier.
Having an unbalanced data set, a balanced mixed model has been used.
As a result we obtain a high average F1 Socre, being decisive in positive type comments (the imbalance comes mainly from here)
